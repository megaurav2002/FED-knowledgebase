# Concepts

NodeJS is a c++ program with V8 embedded and whole bunch of c++ functions to add additional functionality to JS. Some of these additional functionalities are

* Way to deal with files (organising code)
* Talking to DB
* Accepting/sending requests
* Ability to deal with work that takes a long time

## V8

V8 is google's open source javaScript engine and is used in Google Chrome and Node. V8 can be used as a standalone program or can be embedded to a c++ application. V8 can be extended by writting c++ function and linking V8 to it.
