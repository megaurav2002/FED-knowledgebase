# Concepts

## Closure
closure is when a function "remembers" the variables around it even when the function is executed elsewhere.

## Currying
Briefly, currying is a way of constructing functions that allows partial application of a function’s arguments. What this means is that you can pass all of the arguments a function is expecting and get the result, or pass a subset of those arguments and get a function back that’s waiting for the rest of the arguments.
